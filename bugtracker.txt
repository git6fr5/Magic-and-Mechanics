Respawning issue causing respawned transform to be set at -5 on the z axis, which then causes artifacting when rotating (as the player transform moves to +5 z which is deeper than the scenery)

Fixed ---
respawning was being called from an OutOfWorld flag function, which had the wrong vector parameters

Jumping causes an on land event to invoke when taking off as well as on landing. This is causing the jumping animation to glitch. Note that this only seems to happen when the player is standing still.

Fixed ---
Controller was setting the m_Grounded boolean to false when it was called with jump as true. This was wrong as it only needs to add the force when jump is called and then the Collision detection will recognize it has left the ground. Forcing the m_Grounded variable was confusing it and causing it call twice.

Landing is broken again a bit maybe after changing character size - might need to re adjust the ground check
CLIMBING NOT WORKING PROPERLY - move this functionality from a climbing script to a climbCheck and climbable layer like how all the other movement is handled
Bounce not working properly? (it's just very buggy, plus the animations??)

Sometimes when objects fall too fast, they clip through colliders? Perhaps check the collision type (discrete v continuous)
Death animation is not playing for some reason (maybe something wrong with the script, or shuffling the files around changed something(?) or maybe just not enough time
When trying to destroy already accquired boxes, something goes wrong
